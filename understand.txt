    pages are set up but navbar is not responsive. 
    When a user is logged in , then traversing using navbar should not change status of logout back to login.
    Need to add a link on login button and invoke a page where the <Navbar loggedIn={true}></Navbar> so that logged out appear
    Use this by adding <Link className='comps' id='log' to='/'>{props.loggedIn ? 'Profile' : 'Links'}</Link> where if {props.loggedIn}
        is true, it displays profile and if false displays links
}

git push origin --delete yadu - delete origin branch

Link vs anchor tag{
    Refreshing pages are commonly used for applications that require data to be updated frequently, 
    such as stock market data, news feeds, or social media feeds. 
    In these cases, refreshing the page allows the user to see the most up-to-date information 
    without having to manually refresh the page.

    Single non-refreshing page websites, on the other hand, are used for applications that require 
    dynamic content to be loaded without requiring the user to refresh the entire page. 
    This can provide a more seamless and intuitive user experience, as the user can interact 
    with the website without interruptions caused by page refreshes.
}
so if data needs to be up to date we need to replace Link with a or add a refresh button near the data to be updated which will
an <a> to the same page but it will reload data
